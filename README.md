# In-class Build #6 - Bootstrap Grid
This is a mentored build, thus follow the instructor's instructions/questions during the class block. You **MUST** be present in class to get a grade for this assignment. Being in attendance does not guarantee you a grade for this assignment.

## TO DO
The student is to complete the following after the instructor finished that portion of the build:
*  Style and layout the content to match the attached screenshots.
*  Only use Bootstrap classes for styling and layout; no inline styling or custom CSS is allowed!
*  The layout of the last section must be completed using the Bootstrap 12 column grid system correctly.
*  Validate your markup.
*  If you have everything required for the lab you are free to add other Bootstrap styling and/or JavaScript if you want to experiment. Must meet the general overall styling first.
*  **DO NOT modify the supplied svg!** (_you do not need to put the svg into an `img` folder._)

>> **You must be present in class in order to receive a grade for this assessment.**
>> **Labs that do not follow best naming practices, do not validate, or are not a repo version with a clean working tree will receive a 0.**

## Submission
Zip (.zip) up the completed **build-bootstrap-layout** and upload to Moodle for marking and commit your project to GitHub Classroom. You must have at least **2 commits** of your build.
